Dear Grader,
So nothing special, three source files.
linesort.c and numsort.c are very straightforward
(they have all the comments that you might need)
inssort looks a bit different, but that simply because
 I decided to write a small swap function rather then
 do it in the sort itself.
All the test from the score folder looked right.
Best,
Olexiy Burov.
