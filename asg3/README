A few notes about the put method that I deem important:
1) If the key was not previously in the tree it creates
a new node for it and returns the value of the newly
created node.
2) If the key was in the binary tree it would replace
the old value with the new value, but RETURN the old one.

And also a few words about the exit statuses:
Whenever we encounter the wrong line in the database we read
the program prints a message to System.err indicating the line
number with invalid line on it and changing the exit status to 1.

Whenever the program fails to find the airport user searches for,
the corresponding error message is printed to System.err and exit
status changed to 1.

In all the following cases the program does not quit immediatly,
but continues reading the database and user input.

It only exits in three cases:
1) The database cannot be opened.
2) Invalid option was specified.
3) No operands were passed(no database name given).

Best,
