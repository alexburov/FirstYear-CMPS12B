Dear Grader,

There is not much to say, the thing itself is pretty straightforward.
I only looked at the perl example, which professor provided and tried
to implement some part of my program in the same way.
The output is the same except for error
messages(the names are different). I think the comments should be 
adequate there is not much going on ...

Best,

Olexiy Burov.
