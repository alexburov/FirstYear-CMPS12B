Dear Grader,

So I have implemented everything as instructed. There is a memory loss
of 8 bytes, according to valgrind, but it occures in scanner.l,
so that should be fine.

Another thing I think is important to inform you about are
preconditions in my method do_add and do_sub.
The thing is that we always treat bigint *this as the "largest" bigint
while *that is always the "smallest" bigint. It's insured in the method
add_bigint and sub_bigint. I always pass the largest as the first
argument and smallest as the second one.

Anothet detail is that the determoination of the smallest and largest
is done in get_largest() function, which I defined and implemented
myself. So you can think about it as do_compare function in the score
file. Once we know which one is the largest it's easy to figure out
the smallest one.

So far I think these are the only tricky moments about my implementa-
tion of the assignment 4.

Best,

Olexiy Burov.
