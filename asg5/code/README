Dear Grader,

A small note regarding programming assignment #5
I think there is not much to say here, because comments
are very descriptive and it's pretty clear what is going on.

One of the things I should clerify is -xx option scanning.
So, I pass 2 flags there and whenever switch control
recognizes 'x' option I check whether it was found before,
if yes then it must be the second x option.

Another intresting aspect is the dump_hashset() implementation.
In short, I just go through all the indexes counting the lengths of
all present in the hashset chains and increment the value in the 
array lengths, which stores 10 elements. So whenever we encounter a
chain of lenght 2 we increment lengths[2] thus counting all such chains,
the chain with the length 1 increments lengths[1] element respectively.


PS. Spell error is printed to stdout not stderr, because that's what
pspell.perl does! However, file errors are still printed to stderror.

Test5 :
Even though no dictionaries were loaded, we do not exit the program,
because that's what proffesor said for test 5 :
"Print an error message for each word that is not found."
So all the words result in warning and final exit status is,
therefore 1.

Best,

Olexit Burov.
